## About

Path to Kingdoms is an idle game where you build and manage settlements across 8 tiers of civilization, from simple Hamlets to grand Kingdoms. Build structures, generate income, and research technologies to optimize your path to greatness.

### Features

- 🏗️ **Unique Buildings**: Each tier has 6 distinct buildings with different costs, income, and effects
- 🔬 **Research System**: Unlock parallel slots, cost reductions, and automation with research points
- 📈 **Incremental Gameplay**: Watch your settlements grow and multiply automatically
- 🎯 **Random Goals**: Complete varied objectives (income, currency, buildings, survival) to progress
- 💰 **Per-Settlement Economy**: Each settlement has its own currency and goals
- 🛠️ **Dev Mode**: Toggle 1000x income multiplier for faster testing
